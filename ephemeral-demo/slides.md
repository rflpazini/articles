# Ship Faster and Test Smarter with Ephemeral Environments

**Problem**
PRs are hard to review without a live environment. Feedback loops get long. Bugs slip through.

**Architecture**
Buildx and Bake produce a tagged image. Compose deploys a tiny stack. Traefik routes by host. Teardown is one command.

**Value**
Faster feedback. Less risk. Lower cost. A template you can copy today.

**QR**
Repo link and a gist with Makefile and Compose files.
